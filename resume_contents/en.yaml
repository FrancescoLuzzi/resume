  description: |-
    I'm a passionate developer who supports open source and transparent company culture.\
    I have experience building both fullstack applications and tooling, with a strong focus on correctness, performance, and ease of use.\
    My objective is to expand my knowledge of online services that need to handle many users with good availability and responsiveness.\
    More than just solving problems, I focus on the long-term vision, ensuring that today's solutions are flexible for tomorrow's needs.\
    I like constructive feedback, knowing that questioning my ideas can lead to better results.\
    I love digging into everything I use, making sure I understand it and can explain it, so I can also help others.\
    One of my favorite quotes is: "What I cannot create, I do not understand" (Richard Feynman).

      description: Python - Go - TS - Powershell - Bash - Docker - Github
      link: https://github.com/centrosoftware-actions
      infos: |
        - Handled the maintenance and development of the legacy product's installer and updater
        - Developed various GitHub Actions in Powershell, Python, Bash, and Typescript to help streamline\
          testing, releasing, and code analysis in different company projects. Some of these actions are open source.
        - Configured the infrastructure on which many of the company's code automations run,\
          based on heavily customized Docker images and GitHub Actions runners.\
          By aligning my decisions with the company's context, I was able to keep maintenance costs very low\
          and share know-how with other teams, enabling them to work independently.
        - Built a tool to manage the development profiles of the Delphi IDE.\
          Developed in Go and React, designed to simplify the management of multiple development profiles and enable sharing them.
        - Refactored a Python tool used to create and maintain different development environments.\
          Applied both TDD and snapshot testing, since the inputs and outputs of the tool were well known.\
          It is used by all the company's developers, saving time by automating the correct setup of the required development dependencies.

      infos: |
        - The main project I worked on was a smart soft drink dispenser.\
          It's a Python and C project built for custom embedded boards running a Linux distro built using Yocto.\
          My biggest contribution to the project was the complete refactoring of the payment library based on the MDB protocol,\
          which greatly improved the reliability and stability of communication with POS devices.\
          The smart part of the project is the integration with different clouds, used to configure and log machine metrics.\
          The project also has to interface with and manage many other external peripherals, such as NFC receivers, 3G modems, various types of dispensers and microcontrollers.\
          GitLab was used as the version control system and CI/CD platform.
        - The second project I worked on was a CAN-based battery monitoring system written in python.\
          It integrates with ThingsBoard for data visualization, alerting, and real-time remote board configuration.\
          Updates were handled via USB through custom udev rules and bash scripts.

      infos: |
        - I've always wondered how an interpreter worked, so I implemented one
        - My implementation of the `monkey` language is based on the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" with some personal touches
        - The interpreter can be compiled to WASM and used in the browser

      infos: |
        - Since Ubuntu doesn't have a native application to set the battery charge threshold, I built one.
        - Integrates with systemd by creating a service that automatically applies the selected charge level.
